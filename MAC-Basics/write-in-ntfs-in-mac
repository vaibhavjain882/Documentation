sudo mv /sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs.orig

sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/ntfs-3g/2014.2.15/sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs

brew install osxfuse ## If it is already installed then foolow below steps: 

brew info osxfuse   ### It will give you osxfuse version suppose it is 2.7.2.

sudo /bin/cp -RfX /usr/local/Cellar/osxfuse/2.7.2/Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs /Library/Filesystems

sudo chmod +s /Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs/Support/load_osxfusefs
